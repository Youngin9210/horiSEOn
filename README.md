Week 1 Homework for OSU Bootcamp

## Description

This was a homework assignment covering the semantics and accessibility of a webpage.

## Changes made to improve accessibility:

  * **Improved semantics of HTML elements:**
    
    * Changed all `<div>` elements to a more semantic element (section, article, aside, etc.) to fit the content.
    
  * **Ensured that elements followed a logical semantic HTML structure**
    
  * **Ensured that all `<img>` elements have accessible alt attributes**
  
  * **Ensured all links work as expected**
  
  * **Organized and consolitdated CSS selectors to follow semantic structure**
